						<p class="fragment">A developer</p>
						<p class="fragment">An editor</p>
						<p class="fragment">A reporter</p>
						<br>

						<h2>How did I become this person?</h2>
						<p>I was hired at FP to run social media and the homepage.</p>
						<h4>Then I...</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Worked on a glitchy newsletter >> ended up overseeing all newsletters and launching a new one</li>
						<li>Wanted better homepage tools >> ended up project managing the edit side of CMS rebuild</li>

					<large>These are 10 best practices I've learned while bouncing between tech and editorial the past year</large>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Previously on...</h2>
					<p>
						 Work and communicate like you've got a new team of aliens showing up to collaborate every day. Start at step 0 and assume that not everyone is up to speed at all times.
					</p>
					<p>
						Start meeting recaps and project updates like TV shows do before new episodes, with a short "the story so far..." intro.
					<br>
					<p><small>(especially if you are working with a new team or even just one person new to the process)</small></p>
				</section>

				<section class="fragments">
						<h2>Kill scope creep early and often</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Define <span class="fragment highlight-blue">"mission critical"</span> and <span class="fragment highlight-blue">"minimally viable"</span> upfront.</p>
						<p class="fragment">When someone says <span class="fragment highlight-blue">"ASAP"</span>, what does that actually mean??</p>
						<p class="fragment">How many top priority requests can exist at once?</p>
					</section>

				<section>
						<h2>Get organized</h2>
						<h3>Like, really freaking organized.</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Ticketing system (JIRA/Redmine. 1 task = 1 ticket)</li>
						<li>Standing check-in meetings, daily email update, online chat</li>
						<li>Choose a preferred screenshot and screencapture tool -- and teach people how to use it</li>
						<li>Pick a non-Github place for documentation and files to live (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc) and keep it organized</li>
					</ul>
					</section>

				<section>
					<h3>YOU, call 911</h3>
					<p>
						 One thing they teach lifeguards is to always designate a <strong>specific</strong> person to call 911 in an emergency, never saying, <span class="fragment highlight-red">"someone call 911"</span> and pointing vaguely into the crowd. 
					</p>
					<p>
						 Be specific, especially in email communications. Assign tasks to people, not crowds. 
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Being vague wastes time</h2>
					<h3>Don't waste time.</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Don't send emails to report <span class="fragment highlight-red">"the thing is broken"</span> or that you <span class ="fragment highlight-red">"don't like this"</span></li>
						<li>Be specific when you can: <span class="fragment highlight-blue">"this link goes to the wrong place"</span> or <span class="fragment highlight-blue">"can we change the color on xyz-thing?"</span>
						<li>Show don't tell: use annotated screenshots to report bugs that are hard to describe over email</li>
						<li>Use screencapture gifs to show interactions that aren't working the way they should or that you expect.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Wireframes will only get you so far</h2>
					<p>
						 If you're working with folks who aren't intimately involved with the nitty-gritty of how something is built, don't ask them to rely on sketches, mockups and wireframes only.  
					</p>
					<p>"Use your imagination" or "just pretend it doesn't look like this" isn't helpful for building bridges between teams.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>All the "little things" add up</h2>
					<p>
						 Tiny CSS bugs that feel like finishing touches for developers can add up quickly for the other side, making it hard to see progress. 
						</p>
					<p>
						If you can knock through a handful of small requests per week, it can buy you some goodwill on the stuff that will take much longer to solve. 	
						</p>

						</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Manners</h2>
					<p>
						 It sounds dumb, but "please" and "thank you" go a long way -- especially on deadline, especially late at night, especially over email, especially you're so sick of looking at each other, your screens and your project. 
					</p>
					<p>	
						Giving your teammates the benefit of the doubt and assuming best intentions is always a good bet toward saving sanity.
